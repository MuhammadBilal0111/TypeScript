// TypeScript is all about the type Safety
i.e. 2+"2"='22' because in javascript type safety is missing
i.e. null+2=2
i.e. undefined+2=NaN(Not a number)
TypeScript just stop this behaviour

What TypeScript does:
The only job of TypeScript is static checking
static checking: The process of constantly checking the code by the IDE.
Static checking is not in the case of Javascript

when you write Ts code the Ts code transpile in Javascript

It is a development tool which provide you a way to write better code with less problems with a more maintainable and maintainable


const user = {name:"bilal",email:"m.bilal0111@gmail.com"}
console.log(user.password); // TypeScript tells that the password is missing

TypeScript Stored as a dev dependency -> npm i typescript --save-dev

installation: npm i -g typescript
tsc .\intro.ts

let <variableName>:type=value; all datatypes are in lower case
